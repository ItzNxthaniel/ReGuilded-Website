# ReGuilded Website

**ReGuilded** is a client injector/client mod that allows you to extend the functionality of Guilded's client by providing theme and addon support.

## Technologies
The technologies used to make the ReGuilded website:
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React
- Chakra
- Next-I18Next

> **Note**: More will be added soon.

## Self-Hosting
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReGuilded/ReGuilded-website.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```
> **Note**: The project uses `yarn`, otherwise you can choose to use `npm` or `pnpm` instead.

3. Run the local development server
```bash
yarn dev
# or 
npm run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```

You can use another port by adding the `--port` flag.

4. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000/. Or open it to the custom port you used (if you did).
